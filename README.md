## Known Issues

## Overview    
    Attack speed doesn't scale Noctis' animations. Instead it adds 'extra' attacks. For example, 2.5 attack speed means you'll do 3 attacks- 2 attacks that deal 100% damage and proc, while the 3rd attack deals 50% damage and 50% proc. 
    Each weapon has unique attributes to them: 
    Sword has usually faster attacks. Invincibility (i-frames) while using the swap attacks. 
    Greatsword applies vulnerability (debuff on enemies so they take +50% damage per stack additively). Swap attacks always stun. 
    Polearm has longer range and hits 1 extra time on top of attack speed scaling, allowing for more onhit builds. Pressing jump and the polearm input result in a Dragoon thrust, sending yourself towards the ground. Polearm swap attacks hit 2 extra times.

### Passive
