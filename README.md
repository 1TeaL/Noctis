## Latest Changelog, Next update(s)

- 1.3.0-
    - Bug fixes
        - Previously not mentioned but Greatsword neutral properly sends enemies up, and attackspeed does not increase the amount of force for any attack anymore
    - Changes
        - Overall faster animations for most attacks- mainly greatsword attacks and some polearm attacks
        - *New* added weapon cancel animations- now when you're using a weapon swap attack to cancel an attack in it's duration, it will play an animation that starts immediately at the damage animation, making it a lot faster than before.
        - The aim of these change is to make the transition smoother as weapon swap attacks right after a normal attack presents a dangerous gap at times that could result in Noctis being in danger. 
- 1.2.0-
    - Bug fixes
        - Actually fixed Greatsword attacks not all applying vulnerability
        - Fixed vulnerability debuff not actually increasing damage
        - Fixed Greatsword swap attacks not stunning
        - Fixed Greatsword forward not doing damage as it has no radius
        - Fixed Warpstrike not aiming towards a target
        - Dash particle should appear as you use warpstrike now
        - Warpstrike damage scaling fixed, was doing too much damage before.
    - Changes
        - Warpstrike now freezes all enemies nearby on hit if the distance is greater than 50% of the max distance.
        - Improved sword swap forward timing and movement
        - lowered amount of particles when Noctis ground slams
- 1.1.0-
    - Bug fixes
        - Fixed polearm weapon description in lobby to appear under polearm not dodge.
        - Fixed Greatsword attacks not all applying vulnerability
        - Hid messages appearing when using sword attacks
        - Fixed sword swap forward not moving noctis far enough
        - Fixed the target lock on from being able to select players (meaning you could use warp strike to an ally, travelling towards them but also dealing damage.
    - Balance
        - Reduced max mana per level from 10->5. Reduced max mana given from stock based items: magazine- 10->5. lysate 15->10. afterburner 30->15. Reduced natural regen as well. Noctis was not having mana issues too fast, and through attacking gains a decent amount of mana already.
        - Changed window of using jump or dodge to cancel out of attacks to 50% earlier than what it was previously, this is to help some longer animation attacks not get Noctis killed due to enemy projectiles or puddles.
        - Using Dodge no longer resets his current weapon to 'None'. This means he can more easier access the weapon swap attacks.
        - Improved hitbox sizes in general, his rootedness meant he needed larger hitboxes to reach enemies.
        - Changed base damage from 10->12
        - Along with the bug fixes, should make Noctis more in line with other characters in general.
- 1.0.0- Release

- Next update(s)
    - Bug fixes. 
    - Balance? 
    - More Weapons?

## Known Issues

## Overview    
Attack speed doesn't scale Noctis' animations. 

Instead it adds 'extra' attacks. For example, 2.5 attack speed means you'll do 3 attacks- 2 attacks that deal 100% damage and proc, while the 3rd attack deals 50% damage and 50% proc. 

Each weapon has unique attributes to them.
    
    
## Skills
### Passive
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/e39be057-e49d-4a5f-94e6-91d802deca7d" height ="128" >

    Noctis has a mana bar which regenerates over time and through each hit. 
    He is able to jump cancel and dodge cancel his attacks, consuming 10 mana. 
    Attacks can also cancel into attacks.
    Noctis can sprint in any direction and has a double jump.

### Base Skills

#### Dodge 
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/1f212e12-74ec-4e41-8b69-dcebf63bfc21" height ="128" >

    Pressing dodge grants 300 armor during the duration. 
    Allows you to cancel the endlag for attacks.
    Costs 10 mana, reducible by CDR items.
    Using it in the air will have you airstep, gaining a little bit of height.

#### Jumping
Only usable after an attack.

    Pressing the jump button allows you to cancel the endlag for attacks at the same point of when dodges or attacks can cancel.
    Gain as much height as a normal jump approximately.
    Costs 10 mana, reducible by CDR items.
    Holding the jump key and the polearm button results in the Double Dragoon Thrust Swap attack. 

#### Warpstrike 
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/3f402b77-c2b7-495a-a90d-bfe9abfb99ab" height ="128" >

    Warps Noctis towards the target or the direction you're looking at.
    When arriving at an enemy, deal damage, scaling with distance travelled.
    Costs 30 mana, reducible by CDR items.
