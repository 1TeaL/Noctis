## Known Issues
Greatsword overrides primary sometimes- going to a new stage resets this, unknown how to reliably reproduce.

## Overview    
Attack speed doesn't scale Noctis' animations. 

Instead it adds 'extra' attacks. For example, 2.5 attack speed means you'll do 3 attacks- 2 attacks that deal 100% damage and proc, while the 3rd attack deals 50% damage and 50% proc. 

Each weapon has unique attributes to them.
    
    
## Skills
### Passive
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/e39be057-e49d-4a5f-94e6-91d802deca7d" height ="128" >

    Noctis has a mana bar which regenerates over time and through each hit. 
    He is able to jump cancel and dodge cancel his attacks, consuming 10 mana. 
    Attacks can also cancel into attacks.
    Noctis can sprint in any direction and has a double jump.

### Base Skills

#### Dodge 
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/1f212e12-74ec-4e41-8b69-dcebf63bfc21" height ="128" >

    Pressing dodge grants 300 armor during the duration. 
    Allows you to cancel the endlag for attacks.
    Costs 10 mana, reducible by CDR items.
    Attack nearby enemies if you have a weapon out for 100% damage.
    Using it in the air will have you airstep, gaining a little bit of height.

#### Jumping
Only usable after an attack.

    Pressing the jump button allows you to cancel the endlag for attacks at the same point of when dodges or attacks can cancel.
    Gain as much height as a normal jump approximately.
    Costs 10 mana, reducible by CDR items.
    Holding the jump key and the polearm button results in the Double Dragoon Thrust Swap attack. 

#### Warpstrike 
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/NoctisRoR2/assets/93917577/3f402b77-c2b7-495a-a90d-bfe9abfb99ab" height ="128" >

    Warps Noctis towards the target or the direction you're looking at.
    Gain 1 second of invulnerability on use.
    When arriving at an enemy, deal damage, scaling with distance travelled.
    Can be cancelled into from attacks but not itself.
    Costs 30 mana, reducible by CDR items.
    
#### Armiger 
<img src= "https://github.com/1TeaL/Noctis/assets/93917577/92dc53e7-45cb-40a8-b8be-4ea85ceb2e95" height ="128" >

    Requires maxmium mana to be used and provides the Armiger buff.
    Constantly drains mana while active, with the rate reduced while Noctis is damaging an enemy.
    While the buff is active, all nearby projectiles will be destroyed, all mana costs are alleviated and every attack with a proc chance will summon a sword to deal 20% additional damage on the enemy.
